# Analog Computers: Past, Present, and Climate Change

Welcome to my project on "Analog Computers: Past, Present, and Climate Change." I'm developing a book that delves into the history, principles, and future prospects of analog computing. 
This project is a solo endeavor aimed at exploring how the synergy between analog and digital technologies can offer innovative solutions to current environmental challenges.

## Contribution & Feedback

This is an early-stage project and a one-person mission, 
but your input can make a significant difference. 
If you have expertise in analog computing, insights into environmental technology, or suggestions for improving the manuscript; 
feel free to share your thoughts through issues or pull requests. 
For direct discussions or inquiries, reaching out via email is welcomed. (larshalvorhansen1@gmail.com)
