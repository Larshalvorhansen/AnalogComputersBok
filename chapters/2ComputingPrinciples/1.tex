\section{Accuracy and noise}
In comparison to the modern digital cirquits; analog stuff can be quite noisy. 
However, that is not neccecarily a downside.

\section{Artificial Spin Ice!}
Artificial Spin ice (ASI) are, unlike most other man made systems, a mixture of both computation and storage.
This unique quality is made possible by using a system of coupled magnets
